# Smart Lighting System API

The Smart Lighting System API is an application developed for communication between an intelligent lighting system, controlled by an Arduino, and a database. This API allows the Arduino to record lighting events in the database and provides functionality to calculate energy consumption statistics based on the recorded data.

## Features

- Recording of lighting events from the Arduino
- Calculation of energy consumption statistics based on recorded events

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- Sequelize (ORM for database)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
